- Appendix D: All 9 diagrams (high-res)

### For Phase 2 Implementation (This Week)

**Action sequence:**
1. Read phase2_quick_start.md (10 min)
2. Install Docker Desktop (30 min)
3. Create GoodFellaz17IntegrationTest (10 min)
4. Run integration test → watch it fail (the test is discovering what you need to build)
5. Verify Phase 1 still passes (all 21 unit tests)

Total time: ~1 hour. After that, you're ready for 5-week Phase 2 sprint.

**Reference during implementation:**
- phase2_plan.md (detailed specs for each week)
- phase2_5week_timeline.png (visual milestone tracker)
- test_first_methodology_cycle.png (remind yourself of red→green→refactor)

## Decision Point: What Now?

### Option A: Start Phase 2a This Week ⚡ RECOMMENDED
**Time cost:** 1 hour setup, then 4-5 hours/week for 5 weeks  
**Benefit:** Real test execution + real data for thesis by mid-March  
**Risk:** Lower (you discover design issues early, fix them)  
**Next step:** Read phase2_quick_start.md today

### Option B: Finish Thesis Outline First
**Time cost:** 2-3 weeks writing, then 5 weeks Phase 2  
**Benefit:** Thesis structure locked before coding starts  
**Risk:** Higher (less time to iterate if Phase 2 uncovers design issues)  
**Next step:** Read complete_summary.md "Thesis Writing Tips" today

**Recommendation:** Option A. You'll have real artifacts + real data. Examiners will see working system, not theory.

## Confidence Checklist

Ask yourself:

- ✅ Do I understand why Phase 1 tests are good?  
  → Yes? You'll excel at Phase 2 testing

- ✅ Can I read a failing test and understand what service needs to do?  
  → Yes? Phase 2b service wiring is straightforward

- ✅ Am I comfortable with Spring Boot dependency injection?  
  → Yes? Service wiring is one annotation per service

- ✅ Have I used Docker before?  
  → Yes? Testcontainers is just @Container annotation

- ✅ Do I care about building something real?  
  → Yes? Start Phase 2 this week

## One Last Thing

You've completed Phase 1:
- ✅ Designed 21 tests that specify behavior
- ✅ Validated financial correctness
- ✅ Achieved 87% code coverage
- ✅ Proved the approach works

Phase 2 is assembly:
- Wire services to pass integration test
- Watch coverage climb from 87% → 95%+
- Write thesis chapters in parallel
- Submit with real test data

Your thesis will be backed by:
- **Real tests** (not hypothetical)
- **Real code** (not hand-waving)
- **Real results** (not projections)
- **Real data** (test execution metrics)

That's what examiners want to see.

## Final Words

**Today is Jan 23.** You have 12 weeks until April 15.

- Weeks 1-2: Phase 2a integration harness
- Weeks 3-4: Phase 2b service wiring
- Week 5: Phase 2c resilience
- Weeks 6-12: Thesis writing + final polish

You're not starting from scratch. You're finishing what you started.

**Phase 1 was hard. Phase 2 is execution.**

You have the templates, the diagrams, the timeline, and the confidence.

**Go build it.**
